Process Data GDAL raster to Oklahoma mesonet
==========================================

#### Requirements: 
* Used Python 3.5 from anaconda distribution
* Installed GDAL components from [http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks#gdal_complete](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks#gdal_complete)
* Installed other components, but think you can check my requirements.py


Should work, I will update script a little to get system args working to allow you to run without changing code.

### Example Run

>$ ./processData.py file.tif file.mdf
